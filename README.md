## Learning about [React + Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

### Why use React altogether with Redux at all? As an analogy for beginners, I like to use the SQL. Redux gives you a lot of convenience over plain React in terms of storing data on the front-end. It's like an SQL database of your client-side app (not literally, just an analogy). With Redux, you can to query SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE the data in your single state tree. - Kamil Prezeorski ([best place to learn React.js reply on quora](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-place-to-learn-React-js))
